# DMart Stock Management Backend

This backend solution is designed to provide a robust and efficient stock management system for DMart, a leading retailer with a nationwide network of stores. The application handles various operations such as adding new stock, updating existing stock levels, tracking stock movements, and providing real-time visibility into stock levels at different store locations.

## Problem Statement

The current stock management system at DMart lacks efficiency, reliability, and real-time tracking. Manual processes are time-consuming and error-prone, resulting in inaccurate stock levels, missed sales opportunities, and potential customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, the objective is to develop an automated, scalable, and efficient backend system that accurately manages stock levels and provides real-time visibility into stock movements and availability.

## Technical Requirements

- Java: The backend system is developed using Java due to its robustness, efficiency, and widespread industry adoption. Java's object-oriented programming approach ensures modular and maintainable code.
- Spring Boot: The application utilizes the Spring Boot framework for its simplicity and ease of use. Spring Boot enables the development of standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications with embedded servers.
- SQL: SQL is used for managing the database requirements of the system. It stores essential information such as stock details, store locations, and stock movements. SQL's powerful querying capabilities and compatibility with Java make it an ideal choice for this application.

## Features

The backend system offers the following features:

- Add new stock items to the system.
- Update the quantity of existing stock items.
- Delete stock items from the system.
- Track the movement of stock items between different store locations.
- Provide real-time visibility into the quantity of stock items available at each store location.
- Ensure data consistency and integrity.
- Handle a high volume of transactions.
- Ensure system security and restrict access to authorized personnel only.
